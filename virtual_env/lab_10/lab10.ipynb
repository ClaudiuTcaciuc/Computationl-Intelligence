    "The following class provides all tools to play a **tic-tac-toe** game. The game is played on a 3x3 board, where each cell can be empty, or occupied by a player's token (either `X` or `O`). The game is played by two players, `X` and `O`, that alternate in placing their tokens on the board. The game ends when one of the players manages to place three tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all the cells are occupied and no player managed to place three tokens in a row, the game ends in a draw."
